A fully programmable scientific (or graphing) reverse polish notation calculator 

GRAPHING HAS NOT YET BEEN IMPLEMENTED

I am designing a circuit board that you can just buy either as a kit, board only or fully assembled with a case.

this project is a fully programmable scientific reverse polish notation calculator because i wanted one. it will eventualy have graphing and i may put in a "normal" mode so you can just go 5+5 instead of 5 Enter 5 Enter + Enter. i like polish notation so that may never happen. but if you want you can clone it and put that in. just please give me credit where credit is due :)

Wiring.

Uhh first prototype looks awful and the thickness is due to wiring.
